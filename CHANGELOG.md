# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — kernel skeleton (unreleased)

- Cooperative run-to-completion scheduler: ready bitmap with constant-time
  lowest-bit lookup (D1), `AGAIN` yield after `again_limit` steps (D3),
  background tasks in the idle slot, periodic release without drift and with
  missed-period counting, one-shot alarms.
- Events: per-task bits, async-safe posting with platform notify.
- Error policies IGNORE / RESTART / STOP / FATAL, error log ring, single
  fatal exit through `sos_platform_halt`.
- Hooks via function-pointer table (D5).
- `sos_poll` for embedding in an existing main loop (D10).
- Platform contract `platform/sos_platform.h`; host virtual-time platform.
- Host tests for 16/32/64-bit tick widths, also under ASan/UBSan.
- Hand-written configuration example `examples/manual_cfg`.

Not yet: ring buffers, budget/alive supervision and health signal (v0.2),
generator `sosgen` (v0.3).
